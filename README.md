This project is a full-stack property listing web application that allows users to explore, create, and manage rental accommodations with ease. It includes secure user authentication, detailed listing pages, interactive maps for location display, and a responsive interface optimized for all devices. Users can upload images, categorize listings, leave reviews, and filter results based on different property types. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, the database uses MongoDB with Mongoose, and the app integrates Cloudinary for image storage and Map APIs for geolocation. With robust validation, clean routing, and a well-structured MVC architecture, the project demonstrates practical end-to-end implementation of a modern property rental platform.
